# Covid-Project
- Downloaded a dataset from ourworldindata.org regarding Covid*
- Manipulated the base dataset and created two new datasets for vaccination and death regarding Covid
- Used MS SQL Server to add new columns on new information such as total cases, vaccinations, deaths, and percentage compared to population
- Used Tableau to create dashboard that visualizes the data

*Please note the original dataset was too big to be uploaded to github, thus the separation was necessary
